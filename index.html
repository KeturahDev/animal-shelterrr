      <p>This here is Daisy. Daisy was rescued from the horrible brush fires here in Australia. She is in good health as is her Joey, Jack. As you may imagine, we are quite overwhelmed with all the animals we have at our rescue and our specialty being house pets. We need to find a more suitable home for Daisy here.</p>
